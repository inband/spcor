This is to track of progress and set goals.

**25/10/2020** 

It has been about 10 weeks since I started studying the SPCOR.  
My initial plan was to expand my knowledge without any pressure of certification.
The idea was to pick a topic from the blueprint that interests me and take an in-depth look.
I've come to realise that a certification is only going to help in my career.
So far I've really enjoyed the process - so this is a way of setting a goal.

Last 10 weeks
Renew ACM USD$99
1 month of INE USD$89

With this in mind I've set a loose goal of getting CCIE SP by October 31st 2021.  This is ~1 year away.  

I've rented 2RU AU$140 per month from 2nd Nov 2020.  I expect that I'll rent this for a year while I study.
