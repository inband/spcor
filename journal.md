This is to track of progress and set goals.

**25/10/2020** 

It has been about 10 weeks since I started studying the SPCOR.  
My initial plan was to expand my knowledge without any pressure of certification.
The idea was to pick a topic from the blueprint that interests me and take an in-depth look.
I've come to realise that a certification is only going to help in my career.
So far I've really enjoyed the process - so this is a way of setting a goal.

Last 10 weeks

Renew ACM USD$99

1 month of INE USD$89


With this in mind I've set a loose goal of getting CCIE SP by October 31st 2021.  This is ~1 year away.  

I've rented 2RU AU$140 per month from 2nd Nov 2020.  I expect that I'll rent this for a year while I study.

PVE Server installed in DC.

Setup as per INE's CCIE SPv4 Advanced Technologies Topology.

Setup ansible to backup all routers in topology.

Got a bit side tracked and installed vMX in PVE.  I'd like to learn more about Juniper at the same time - I'll have to work out a way of fitting in the above topology.  Name ```VMX1``` connect to XR2 **vlan 1215** 10.12.15.0/24 and 2001:12:15::/64 and ```lo0 15.15.15.15/32 2001::15/128```

Next:

Video:
* Cisco Lessions Luc De Ghein's MPLS Fundametals
* Cisco Live Breakout sessions - try and watch one a week.  


Reading:

* MPLS Fundamentials
* MPLS in SDN era
* Cisco ISP Essentials


I need to start going through the INE SPv4 workbook.

**29/11/2020**

Been a bit side tracked.  Since installing vMX I've been reading and labbing "MPLS in SDN era" and "Juniper MX Series".  
I really don't mind going off-track.  Junos offers a different perspective and I probably need to slow down and enjoy 
learning.  I don't think it is a bad - since it builds on my fundamentals and to me this is the most important 
thing to develop.

The reality is I do need a certification for career progression but work is tough enough atm without the extra
self-pressure.  I have another 2 months before the next push.


---------------------------------------------
So routhly breaking up the next 12 months.

**Nov-Jan**
* Cover as many topics in blueprint as I can.
* At a high level - no pressure

**Feb-April**
* Work out where I'm weakest - what do I need to work on?
* 1 month INE
* Make sure all topics covered IPv4

**May-July**
* Revisit all topics but with IPv6

**Aug-Oct**
* Study hard
* 1 month INE
